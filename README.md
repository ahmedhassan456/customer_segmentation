# Customer Segmentation using KMeans

## Project Overview

This project performs customer segmentation using **KMeans Clustering**. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on common characteristics such as behavior, demographics, and purchase history. This can help businesses personalize marketing efforts and improve customer satisfaction.

The dataset used in this project contains transactional data from an online retail store. Key features of the dataset include:
- **Invoice Number**: Transaction identifier
- **Stock Code**: Product identifier
- **Description**: Name of the product
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold
- **Invoice Date**: Date of the transaction
- **Unit Price**: Price per unit of the product
- **Customer ID**: Unique customer identifier
- **Country**: Customer location

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - The dataset is loaded, and basic data exploration is performed to understand its structure and quality.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Filtering necessary features for clustering
   - Scaling the data for optimal KMeans performance

3. **KMeans Clustering**:
   - Implementing the KMeans algorithm to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
   - Optimal number of clusters determined using methods like the **elbow method**.

4. **Results and Insights**:
   - Visualizing clusters to understand different customer segments and their characteristics.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform customer segmentation analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb
```

## Insights
- The clusters reveal distinct groups of customers with similar purchasing behaviors.
- These insights can be used to target customer groups with tailored marketing strategies.
